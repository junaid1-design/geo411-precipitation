R analysis of precipitation data for Buffalo and San Diego

Precipitation Analysis: Buffalo and San Diego

Overview
This project looks at annual precipitation in Buffalo and San Diego from 1940–2025 to compare climate patterns and variability between two very different regions.

Methods
The data were analyzed in R using summary statistics, histograms, and t-tests. The dataset was split into early and late time periods to test for changes over time. Probabilities were calculated using both normal assumptions and observed data.

Key Findings
Buffalo shows a significant increase in average annual precipitation in recent decades, while San Diego does not. Normal distribution assumptions work reasonably well for Buffalo, but are less appropriate for San Diego due to skewed rainfall patterns.

Tools
R, RStudio, CSV Data File

Reflection
This project showed how important it is to understand the shape of data before applying statistical models, especially when working with real-world climate data.
